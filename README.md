# Headless CMS and publishing workflow

## using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

- [x] Started from https://github.com/markdoc/next.js-starter
- [x] Deployed to Netlify using GitHub integration
    * Next.js is being used in the simplest possible way, basically as a static site generator (SSG).
- [x] Added custom domain with SSL/TLS https://cloudnative.ricegeo.dev/
- [x] Added minimal amount of content for a possible Cloud-Native Geospatial site
    * No effort spent on styling or layouting
- [x] Explored some ideas for "Headless CMS"
- [x] Created a custom React component as a new markdown tag.
- [x] Tested out Netlify's debploy previews feature.
